# A class method is a method that is bound to the class and not the object of the class
# They have the access to the state of the class as it takes a class parameter that points to the class
# it can modify a class state that would apply across all the instances of the class

# A static method is also a method that is bound to the class and not the object of the class
# This method canâ€™t access or modify the class state
# generally use static methods to create utility functions
