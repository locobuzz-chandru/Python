# YAML (yet another markup language) is a human-readable data serialization language that is used for writing configuration files
# YAML allows us to represent complex data structures in a human-readable format. It is unambiguous. YAML unambiguously
# specifies the data structures of the serialized data, so there's no need to rely on comments or documentation.
