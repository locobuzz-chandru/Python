# Hashing is the process of scrambling raw information to the extent that it cannot reproduce it back to its original
# form
# In encryption, data is transformed into a secure format that is unreadable unless the recipient has a key

# When a user enters a password, the hash value is calculated and then compared with the table. If it matches one of the
# saved hashes, itâ€™s a valid password and the user can be permitted access

# It takes a piece of information and passes it through a function that performs mathematical operations on the
# plaintext. This function is called the hash function, and the output is called the hash value
#  websites store user passwords in a hashed format for two benefits. It helps foster a sense of privacy, and it lessens
#  the load on the central database since all the digests are of similar size

# The SHA-256 hash can be used as a secure 64 char password
# SHA-256 generates almost unique 32-bit hash

# By default, Django uses the PBKDF2 algorithm with a SHA256 hash (Password-Based Key Derivation Function)
# the length is exactly 64 bits short of a multiple of 512. During the addition, the first bit should be one, and the
# rest of it should be filled with zeroes

# Salts are used to keep passwords safe while they are being stored


# BCrypt Algorithm is used to hash and salt passwords in a secure way
